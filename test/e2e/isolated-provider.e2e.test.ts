/**
 * isolated-provider.e2e.test.ts — reachability guard for PR #152 (issue #151).
 *
 * PR #152 fixes isolated subagents dropping extension-registered custom providers
 * on Pi >= 0.80.8 (the `modelRegistry` → `modelRuntime` migration). agent-runner
 * forwards the parent's runtime, read off the ModelRegistry facade as
 * `ctx.modelRegistry.runtime` via `as unknown as { runtime }`.
 *
 * That forwarding is already guarded by the unit test in test/agent-runner.test.ts
 * ("passes the parent model runtime …") — but against a MOCK whose `.runtime` is
 * hand-set. The mock cannot catch the one thing that would silently break the fix:
 * `.runtime` is a `private readonly` field on the real ModelRegistry, absent from
 * the public type AND the package exports. If a future Pi renames it, makes it a
 * true #private, or moves the module, the cast quietly yields `undefined`, the fix
 * omits `modelRuntime`, and the bug returns with no failing test.
 *
 * This test closes exactly that gap and nothing else: it asserts the real facade
 * exposes a runtime-reachable `.runtime` that IS the runtime it wraps. It is not a
 * guard for the forwarding itself (that's the unit test's job) — a fuller e2e that
 * drives real `runAgent` end-to-end is tracked as a follow-up.
